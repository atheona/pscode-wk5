// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Declare the variable to hold the number
Read the number from the user
If num % 2 == 0 then
	Print "The number is even"
Else
	Print "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Declare five separate numbers from user: num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5
b) Loop to read five separate numbers
	Add the number to the sum
	sum = sum + numbers
   Calculate the average
	average = sum/5
   Print "The average of the number is:"
c) Declare integer min = numbers
   Declare integer max = numbers
   Loop to find minimum and maximum
	If num < min then
		min = num
        If num > max then
		max = num
   Print "The smallest number is:", min
   Print "The largest number is:", max
d) Print "The average of the entered numbers is:" + average
   Print "The smallest of the entered numbers is:" + minimum
   Print "The largest of the entered numbers is:" + maximum
